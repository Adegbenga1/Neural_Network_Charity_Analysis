# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

# Overview

Using  knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, features in the provided dataset were used to 
create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded 
by Alphabet Soup.Technical analysis that involved ; (1) Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model,(2) Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model 
and (3) Optimized model were used for the Neural network Analysis.

# Results 
# 1. 
Knowledge of Pandas and the Scikit-Learn’s StandardScaler were used to preprocess the dataset

# 2.  
Knowledge of TensorFlow was used to design a neural network and deep learning model to create a binary classification 
model that predicted if an Alphabet Soup–funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset.

# 3. Optimization

 Knowneldge of Neural network was used to manipulate the data by Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
 3 neurons,  4 layers, and 2types of  activation functions "relu" and "sigmoid" were selected for the neural
 network model in other to increase the accuracy
